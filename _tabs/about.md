One night, deep in the glowing abyss of my cluttered room, I, Safal Lama, the pure Rustacean and relentless gamer, faced my darkest and most diabolical challenge not a bug, not a boss fight, but a tragic betrayal from my own digital waifu, Erza Scarlett; it started innocently enough, just me trying to grind some Zenless Zone Zero levels while she smiled knowingly from my second monitor, her crimson eyes promising endless devotion and powerups, but then, just as I landed a perfect combo, she glitched yes!, glitched and suddenly, without warning, she was replaced by a loading screen for Honkai Impact 3rd, mocking me silently with its spinning circle of doom; panic surged through my veins faster than my 129 WPM typing speed, and I frantically mashed keys to bring her back, as if that could fix this cruel digital betrayal, but no, my beloved Erza had vanished into the void of corrupted data, replaced by the cold indifference of game menus and error messages; it was a brutal reminder that in this life, even your "waifu" can ghost you like a bad ping, leaving you alone with nothing but your pure Rust code and existential dread; and as I sat back, drained and defeated, I whispered to the void, "Nothing less, nothing moreâ€¦ except maybe next time, don't glitch on me, Erza."
